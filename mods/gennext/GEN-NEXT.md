Generation NEXT!
================

Generation NEXT makes the following changes:

Major changes:

- Drives will change Genesect's typing immediately after switch-in, to Bug/Ice,
  Bug/Fire, Bug/Electric, or Bug/Water. (Basically, it will change Genesect's
  type, except Genesect will still take neutral damage from SR)

- Unown gets an item named Strange Orb (select "Stick" in the teambuilder)
  It triples its SpA and doubles its Spe, and changes its type to the type
  of its Hidden Power.

- Bug/Flying Quiver Dancers get an item named GossamerWing (select "Stick"
  in the teambuilder). It negates the Flying weaknesses (take half damage from
  Rock, Ice, and Electric moves, and SR). In addition, they all get Hurricane.

- Weather-inducing abilities now last for only 5 turns (and are unaffected by
  items). Weather moves have +1 priority. Forecast and Flower Gift will make
  weather moves last forever.

- Flower Gift has an additional effect: if Sunny Day is used, the next switch-in
  receives +1 Atk, +1 SpD

Minor changes:

- Perfect accuracy moves with a base power of 60 have their base power
  increased to 80

- Drives grant a 1.3x damage bonus to Techno Blast

- Multi-hit moves are now all perfect-accuracy

- Twineedle has a new base power of 50

- Tri Attack now hits 3 times and has a base power of 30

- Masquerain gets Surf and Sleep Powder
