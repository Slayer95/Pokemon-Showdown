Generation NEXT!
================

Generation NEXT makes the following changes:

Major changes:

- Drives will change Genesect's typing immediately after switch-in, to Bug/Ice,
  Bug/Fire, Bug/Electric, or Bug/Water. (Basically, it will change Genesect's
  type, except Genesect will still take neutral damage from SR)

- Unown gets an item named Strange Orb (select "Stick" in the teambuilder)
  It doubles its SpA and Spe, and changes its type to the type of its Hidden
  Power.

- Bug/Flying Quiver Dancers get an item named GossamerWing (select "Stick"
  in the teambuilder). It negates the Flying weaknesses (take half damage from
  Rock, Ice, and Electric moves, and SR).

- Weather-inducing abilities now last for only 5 turns (and are unaffected by
  items). Weather moves have +1 priority. Forecast and Flower Gift will make
  weather moves last forever.

- Moves with a charge turn are now a lot more powerful. They remove Protect and
  Substitute before hitting, they always crit (although their base power has
  been adjusted accordingly), they have perfect accuracy, and one other change
  depending on the move:
  - SolarBeam: heal 33% on the charge turn, 60 bp
  - Razor Wind: 100% confusion, 40 bp
  - Skull Bash: +1 Def, +1 SpD on the charge turn, 50 bp

  receives +1 Atk, +1 SpD
